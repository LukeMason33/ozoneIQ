  "The Air Quality Index (AQI) reports on how clean or polluted the air in your area is, and can indicate what effects prolonged exposure to outdoor air may have on your health. It takes into account 5 major air pollutants: ground-level ozone, particle pollution, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide.", 
  "Poor air quality can be especially harmful to people with compromised respiratory systems, lung or heart health, children, and older adults. When the AQI is high, everyone should be aware of how much time they are spending exposed to outdoor pollutants, especially individuals with compromised health.",
  "Air pollution is strongly affected by weather, though some pollutants are worse in heat while others are worse in cold weather. During extreme heat waves, stagnant air contributes to pollution levels, and droughts can lead to higher occurrences of forest fires, which in turn adds to the carbon monoxide and particle pollution in the atmosphere. In cold weather, thermal inversion forms when a layer of warm air higher in the atmosphere traps cool air and pollution closer to the ground. Thermal inversions are more common in cities where cold, dense air gets trapped in mountain basins or valleys."]
